# mall-directory-scraper
Created a mall directory scraper based on https://singmalls.app/en

- singmalls_scraper.py creates a CSV file for a specific URL. It'll work even if it's not pointed at https://singmalls.app/en
- 100AM_tenants.csv is generated from singmalls_scraper.py as an example
- allsingmalls_scraper creates a CSV file for all malls' directory listed in https://singmalls.app/en
- malls_tenant.csv is generated from allmalls_scraper.py as an example
- tester.py was used for unit testing to make sure parts worked before I placed it into the main python files
